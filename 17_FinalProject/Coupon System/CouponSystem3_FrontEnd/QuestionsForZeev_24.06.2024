1. 	Location: Pages/Company/AddCoupon (same with   AddCompany, AddCustomer)
	Line 42 - how to dispatch newly added coupon to redux so it will contain the correct id?
	(right now, added with no ID - can't view coupon)
	
	Solution: Change BE function to return the newly created object's id.
	Use this 'response' object in redux to update the new id and add the new object to redux.

2. 	Location: UpdateCoupon (same with 'AddCoupon')
	Line 79 / 105: 'defaultValue' doesn't work when using the 'TextField' element.
	How to solve this?
	
	Solution: use 'input' only

3. 	Location: UpdateCoupon (same with 'AddCoupon')
	Line 122: 'defaultValue' also doesn't work for 'select' element (when trying to insert a 'Category as string' type value).
	
	Solution: Change 'Category' to 'enum' type

4. 	Location: UpdateCoupon (same with update company, update customer)
	Line (after submit): How to force form to receive default values if not changed? (example: image, title, description - are empty if not edited) 
	
	Solution: read about 'useForm' or add comparisons to original values in 'onSubmit'
	
5. Filtering (coupons by Category, 	coupons by Price)  - is it better to use redux functions instead or filter in the page?

	Solution: better to use local filter, and not redux
